**Day 1: Setting up Environment**

Objective: Prepare Python environment and libraries for Sign Language Recognition System.

Steps Completed:

Installed Python 3.10 in Anaconda (because TensorFlow/Keras/Mediapipe work best with 3.8â€“3.11).

Created a virtual environment:
conda create -n signlang python=3.10
conda activate signlang


Installed required libraries:
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras mediapipe numpy matplotlib


Verified libraries inside the environment:

import cv2\n
import tensorflow as tf\n
import keras\n
import mediapipe as mp\n
import numpy as np\n
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n
